Mod for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide

It plays Disposal Unit (Imperium Mix) when:
- "Last Man Standfing"(CLUTCH) objective.
Settings: On/Off.

- During game objectives.
Like:
music_objective = {
collect_event = "collect_event",
control_event = "control_event",
demolition_event = "demolition_event",
escape_event = "escape_event",
fortification_event = "fortification_event",
hacking_event = "hacking_event",
kill_event = "kill_event",
last_man_standing = "last_man_standing",
prologue_combat = "prologue_combat",
},

And more for each map. For example in Mortis Trials each wave it's objective.
Settings: Chance 0%-100%. Default: 20%. 

- On boss fights.
Settings: Chance 0%-100%. Default: 20%. 

Limitations:
Will not trigger "last_man_standing"/boss music if you are already on a objective.
